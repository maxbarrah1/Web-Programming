<h3>Hello Stranger,</h3>
<p>A burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself when wrapped. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", that is to say covered in a savory and spicy sauce, where they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p1>
